# senior-thesis

This is the repository for all my senior thesis work :cowboy_hat_face:

I have an unofficial [thesis-blog](https://github.com/AriaKillebrewBruehl/senior-thesis/blob/main/thesis-blog.md) that houses brain-dump regarding my thoughts and feelings about the process!

## thesis goals

The goal of my thesis is to write a program that can render photographs as stipples drawings like the [hedcuts in the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-in-a-hedcut-depends-how-its-made-11576537243).
