# senior-thesis

This is the repository for all my senior thesis work :cowboy_hat_face:

I plan to keep an unofficial [thesis-blog](https://github.com/AriaKillebrewBruehl/senior-thesis/blob/main/thesis-blog.md) that houses brain-dump regarding my thoughts and feelings about the process!

## matter
The `matter` folder houses the couple of files that Jim gave me when we were thinking about doing a `matter.js` thesis.

## hello-*
All folders that start with `hello-` house work I have done to familiarize myself with libraries and algorithms.
